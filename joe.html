                    <p>My name is Joe Pagani.  I am originally from Long Island, NY.  My wife and I moved
                        out to Washington about 7 years ago when I enlisted in the Navy.  I spent 4 years 
                        on the USS Nimitz as a plane director working on the flight deck.  I got out in 2016
                        and we decided to continue to call Washington Home.  Both my wife and I are Skiier/Snowboarders 
                        and love the West Coast mountains.  I decided to persue an education in Web Developement starting at the coding Dojo in bellevue,
                        since I have always had a passion for computers and building websites, I realized that, that
                        was what I wanted to do for a living.  Finding a difficult to find solely on what I knew and not having a degree
                        to back it up I decided to enroll in College and and get a degree.  Through this program I hope 
                        to finally be able to work doing what I love and enjoy.
