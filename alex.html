                    <p>When I was very young I constantly took things apart and analyzed a 
                      lot of technical stuff, my parents replaced the home phone quite a few 
                      times because of me. I have always been interested in how things work. It 
                      is my goal to complete my schooling so I have the tools and knowledge to 
                      be able to create anything I desire. With this project I have learned so 
                      much about working with a group within the coding world. It was quite difficult 
                      merging code together, although it was a fun experience to understand how groups 
                      of people can create software as a whole. </p>
