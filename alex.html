                    <p>My name is Alex Seeler, I was born on February 2nd, 2000 in Mesquite, 
                      Texas and raised in Sammamish, Washington. I was introduced to the life of 
                      Computer Science and Engineering at a young age through my father. He has been a 
                      big influence on my interest in technology because he is a software developer. 
                      Through the years I was constantly playtesting the games he would be working on 
                      (Left-4-Dead, Half Life, Portal, etc.) After my 18th birthday I moved down to Seattle to start 
                      my academic journey to my career goal. I work part-time at MOD Pizza and in my spare 
                      time I enjoy binge-watching sci-fi or thriller films (I am a major film critic). Aside 
                      from technology, and video games, Iâ€™m interested in: politics, chemistry, and psychology. 
                      My goal for my future is to work for SpaceX and design robots to build the first colony on Mars.</p>
